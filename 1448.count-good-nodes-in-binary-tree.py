#
# Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path
# from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.
#
# Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
#
#
# Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
# Root Node (3) is always a good node.
# Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
# Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
# Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.
#
# Example 2:
#
#
#
#
# Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Node 2 -> (3, 3, 2) is not good, because "3" is higher than it.
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: root = [1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: Root is considered as good.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5].
# Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4].
#
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        cnt = 0
        def good(x, m):
            nonlocal cnt
            if x is None:
                return
            if x.val >=m :
                cnt += 1
                m = x.val
            good(x.left, m)
            good(x.right, m)
        good(root, -float('inf'))
        return cnt
