#
# Given a rows x cols screen and a sentence represented by a list of non-empty
# words, find how many times the given sentence can be fitted on the screen.
#
#
# Note:
#
# A word cannot be split into two lines.
# The order of words in the sentence must remain unchanged.
# Two consecutive words in a line must be separated by a single space.
# Total words in the sentence won't exceed 100.
# Length of each word is greater than 0 and won't exceed 10.
# 1 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 20,000.
#
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# rows = 2, cols = 8, sentence = ["hello", "world"]
#
# Output:
# 1
#
# Explanation:
# hello---
# world---
#
# The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
#
#
#
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# rows = 3, cols = 6, sentence = ["a", "bcd", "e"]
#
# Output:
# 2
#
# Explanation:
# a-bcd-
# e-a---
# bcd-e-
#
# The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.
#
#
#
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input:
# rows = 4, cols = 5, sentence = ["I", "had", "apple", "pie"]
#
# Output:
# 1
#
# Explanation:
# I-had
# apple
# pie-I
# had--
#
# The character '-' signifies an empty space on the screen.

class Solution:
    def wordsTyping(self, sentence: List[str], rows: int, cols: int) -> int:
        l = [len(s) for s in sentence]
        if max(l) > cols:
            return 0
        ll = len(sentence)

        i = c = w = r = 0
        repeat = dict()
        while rows > 0:
            while c + l[w] <= cols:
                c += l[w] + 1
                w = (w+1)%ll
                i += (w == 0)
            c = 0
            rows -= 1
            r += 1
            #print('out', c, w, i, r)
            if w in repeat:
                pr, pi = repeat[w]
                dr = r - pr
                di = i - pi
                #print(dr, di, rows, i)
                i += di * (rows // dr)
                rows %= dr
            else:
                repeat[w] = r, i
