# Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. The new
# list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
#
# Example:
#
#
# Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
# Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        head = ListNode(None)
        curr = head
        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val < l2.val:
                curr.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                curr.next = l2
